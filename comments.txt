This is a good start, and I think you have the general idea down. You have an error in your code since you set a variable equal to "**", which is a reserved keyword. I also don't understand why you're defining the variables and functions twice: are they supposed to do two different things? More comments would help with that. I'd be happy to have a meeting if you need to step through this.
